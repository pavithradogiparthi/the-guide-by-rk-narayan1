raju was sitting on the river side.The place was very quiet.A person passing on that way by walk was tired and sat near to raju on river steps.Raju asked the man where are yu from to break the silence.the man replied he was coming from mangal from his daughters house who was married to her sisters son.raju liked this rambling talk.Raju stroked his chin thoughtfully.it was smooth .He had had his last shave two days before and paid for that with the hard earned coins of his jail life.when he put his hand on his chin he went into the past that when he came out of the jail and while shaving his chin barber asked him are you coming out of the jail.then raju asked him how did you know that.then barber replied that he was spending his twwenty years of time shaving people there.hthe barber asked him havn't you noticed that this is the first shop as you left the jail gate and said half to the trick to earn good is have your business in the right place.
